🎯 **Scenarios**

* **Breakout Path:**
  Push above \$105,500 → reclaim daily structure → challenge \$107,800–108,000 → continuation toward \$110,000–111,000 only if volume and MACD flip bullish

* **Rejection Path:**
  Failure to hold VAL at \$105,470 → breakdown toward \$103K → acceleration to \$100K psychological level if structure breaks

* **Trap Zone to Watch:**
  \$107,800–\$108,500 — Pre-POC rejection band; weak rallies here could trap breakout buyers
