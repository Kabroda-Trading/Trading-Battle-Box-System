🎯 **Scenarios**

* **Breakout Path:**
  Push above \$105,500 → reclaim daily structure → challenge \$107,800–108,000 → continuation toward \$110,000–111,000 only if volume and MACD flip bullish

* **Rejection Path:**
  Failure to hold VAL at \$103,778 → breakdown toward \$102K → acceleration to \$100K psychological level if structure breaks

* **Trap Zone to Watch:**
  \$104,800–\$105,500 — low-volume node above POC. Weak bounces here may lure breakout buyers into failed moves
