📉 **Trade Paths**

* **Bullish Scenario:**

  * Backtest of POC (\$103,462) holds as support
  * Price consolidates above 21 EMA on 15M, prints higher low
  * Break and hold above \$104,259 confirms bullish continuation toward \$104,800–105,000 zone

* **Bearish Scenario:**

  * Failure to hold \$103,685 range low leads to sharp retrace
  * Breakdown below \$103,250 VAL with volume = sell trigger
  * Next downside targets: \$102,900 and \$102,532

🧠 **Execution Watchouts:**

* Still inside prior range from Friday’s session — breakout not confirmed yet
* Expect potential backfill toward POC or 30M range low before next leg
* Volume spikes on 5M needed to validate any upside continuation
* Stay cautious of fakeout above VAH if 4H structure doesn’t shift
