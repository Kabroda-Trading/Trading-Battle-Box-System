## 🧱 Setup Overview

This case captures a high-probability breakout setup built from the 3:00–7:00 AM CST session using the **Fixed Range Volume Profile (FRVP)** as the anchor.

BTC formed a structural base overnight, established a clean **Point of Control (POC)**, and then executed a breakout with a textbook confirmation sequence at 7:00 AM CST.

This setup is foundational to the Trading Battle Box System.

## 🔎 Key Structure Zones (from FRVP: 3:00–7:00 AM CST)

* **POC:** \~103,500
* **VAL:** \~103,250
* **VAH:** \~103,700
* **Breakout Trigger:** 103,800

## 🧠 Trade Logic (As It Unfolded)

1. **Pre-Breakout Setup:**

   * Market was compressing between VAH and POC from 3:00–6:30 AM.
   * Stochastic reset, MACD tightening, RSI holding mid-range — showed energy build-up.

2. **7:00 AM CST Open:**

   * Candle opened **above VAH**, pushed into **103,800+**, and closed strong.
   * Volume spike confirmed breakout attempt.
   * Higher low had already formed overnight, creating bullish structure.

3. **Backtest Confirmation:**

   * Price dipped slightly back into VAH/POC zone (\~103,700–103,500).
   * Buyers held the line — wick rejection + follow-up green candle = entry trigger.

4. **Execution:**

   * **Entry Zone:** 103,700–103,800
   * **Stop:** Below POC or most recent HL (\~103,250)
   * **Target Zones:**

     * 1st TP: 104,250 (structure)
     * 2nd TP: 104,800 (morning range projection)
     * 3rd TP: 105,500+ (VRVP zone + 200 EMA zone on 1H)

## 📚 Key Takeaways

* 🔁 **Wash, Rinse, Repeat Setup** — Classic VAH reclaim and launch.
* ⚠️ **Missed Opportunity Alert** — Live conversation focused on waiting for another backtest too late into the structure.
* 🧠 **Cognitive Bias Check** — Must stay forward-looking with support confirmations. Once the move starts, it doesn’t wait for us.
* 🧰 **System Anchor Point** — Save this setup as a core Trade Trigger template.
