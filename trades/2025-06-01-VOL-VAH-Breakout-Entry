🧠 Trade Recap – Sunday, June 1
Timeframe: 15M

Setup: VAH reclaim breakout after support held at VAL + bounce above POC

Entry: 104,047

Stop: 103,837 (just below POC and structure retest)

TP: 104,679 (right at volume node shelf resistance)

🔍 Price Action Validation:
6:30 AM: Hovering inside VAL/POC range

7:00 AM: Broke above VAH, then snapped back inside

7:30 AM: Retest and close above POC (first strong long signal)

8:00 AM: Candle reclaims VAH and holds → long entry valid

8:15–8:45 AM: Clean structure hold → trend continuation confirms trade logic

📊 Why This Works
Clean 15M HL built at POC zone after prior L→H reversal

MACD flipped positive, RSI uptrend intact, volume rising

You built the setup around real-time confirmation instead of hope

Risk-to-reward is excellent (~1.5R+), and your invalidation was clear
